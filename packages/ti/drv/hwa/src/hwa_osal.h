 *
 *   @brief
 *      This is the sample OS Adaptation layer which is used by the HWA
 *      driver. The OSAL layer can be ported in either of the following
 *      manners to a native OS:
 *
 *      <b> Approach 1: </b>
 *      @n  Use Prebuilt Libraries
 *           - Ensure that the provide an implementation of all
 *             Osal_XXX API for their native OS.
 *           - Link the prebuilt libraries with their application.
 *           - Refer to the "example" directory for an example of this
 *       @n <b> Pros: </b>
 *           - Customers can reuse prebuilt TI provided libraries
 *       @n <b> Cons: </b>
 *           - Level of indirection in the API to get to the actual OS call
 *
 *      <b> Approach 2: </b>
 *      @n  Rebuilt Library
 *           - Create a copy of this file and modify it to directly
 *             inline the native OS calls
 *           - Rebuild the UART Driver library; ensure that the Include
 *             path points to the directory where the copy of this file
 *             has been provided.
 *           - Please refer to the "test" directory for an example of this
 *       @n <b> Pros: </b>
 *           - Optimizations can be done to remove the level of indirection
 *       @n <b> Cons: </b>
 *           - UART Libraries need to be rebuilt by the customer.
