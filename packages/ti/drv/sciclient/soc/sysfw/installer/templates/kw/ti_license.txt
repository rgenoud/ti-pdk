Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages or limitation on how long an implied warranty lasts, the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

11. Security.  

a.	Security. Neither TI nor its licensors will be liable or responsible in any way if unauthorized persons gain access to, copy, change, delete, or damage data, information, applications, code, functions, features, or operation of the Licensee Products. You are responsible for properly configuring and using TI Devices or Licensed Materials and taking Your own independent steps to maintain appropriate security and protection of Your Licensee Products and any associated data from unauthorized access. 
    
b.	Security Keys. If the Licensed Materials are used to embed security keys in TI Devices via e-fusing, this provision applies. You may not use development keys in production. You are solely responsible for evaluating the adequacy of, selecting, obtaining, or generating any keys that may be used in Licensee Products, including obtaining all necessary rights, licenses, and authorizations in and to those keys. TI is not responsible for the integrity, operation, or security of Your keys in TI Devices or their use in Licensee Products, or for the consequences of third parties using, gaining access, overcoming or bypassing such keys. You acknowledge that the Licensed Materials can fail to e-fuse the TI Devices due, for example, to incorrect or aborted program sequence or if you omit a sequence step. Further the TI Device may fail to secure boot if the error code correction check fails for the Production Keys or if the image is not signed and optionally encrypted with the current active Production Keys. Either are examples of situations that will render the TI Device inoperable and TI will be unable to confirm the TI Devices conformed to their specifications prior to the attempted e-fuse. You accept that use of the Licensed Materials to e-fuse (or to attempt to e-fuse) security keys into the TI Devices permanently alters them and, consequently, TI will have no liability (warranty or otherwise) for any such altered TI Devices. 

You will not, under any circumstance, disclose any of the Production Keys or portions of Production Keys to TI.  If you disclose any of the Production Keys to TI, those Production Keys will not be regarded as confidential information. You recognize and accept that it may be possible for sufficiently determined, skilled or equipped persons to gain access to, overcome and/or bypass Production Keys implemented in TI Devices.

12. Indemnification Disclaimer.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT TI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR AND SHALL NOT DEFEND OR INDEMNIFY YOU AGAINST ANY THIRD PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIM THAT RELATES TO OR IS BASED ON YOUR MANUFACTURE, USE, OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS OR YOUR MANUFACTURE, USE, OFFER FOR SALE, SALE, IMPORTATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF YOUR PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE OR INCORPORATE THE LICENSED MATERIALS.

13. No Technical Support.  TI and its licensors are under no obligation to install, maintain or support the Licensed Materials.  

14. Notices.  All notices to TI will be delivered to Texas Instruments Incorporated, 13588 N. Central Expressway, Mail Station 3999, Dallas, Texas 75243, Attention: Contracts Administration, with a copy to tilegalnotices@list.ti.com. All notices will be deemed served when received by TI. 

15. Export Control.  The Licensed Materials are subject to export control under the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”).

Any software export classification made by TI shall not be construed as a representation or warranty regarding the proper export classification for such software or whether an export license or other documentation is required for the exportation of such software.

16. Governing Law and Severability; Waiver.  This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without reference to conflict of laws principles.  If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Agreement to be unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible to effectuate the intent of the parties, and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
