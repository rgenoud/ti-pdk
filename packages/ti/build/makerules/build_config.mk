# Build configuration make file - This file contains all the options that are
#                                 frequently changed
#
# This file changes when:
#     1. Format needs to change (eg: COFF/ELF)
#     2. Endian-ness needs to change (little/big)
#     3. Global compiler and linker options need to change (one entry for each core)
#

# Global options

# Endianness : Allowed values = little | big
ENDIAN = little

# Format : Allowed values = COFF | ELF
FORMAT = ELF
